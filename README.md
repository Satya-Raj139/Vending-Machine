# Console Vending Machine

A Java console application that simulates a fully functional vending machine. This project demonstrates core Java concepts including Object-Oriented Programming, Collection frameworks, and Exception Handling.

##  Features

* **Inventory Management:** Uses `HashMap` for fast item lookups.
* **Input Handling:** Robust user input handling using `Scanner` (prevents crashes on invalid inputs).
* **Custom Exceptions:** Implements `OutOfStockException` and handles logic for insufficient funds.
* **Transaction Loop:** Runs continuously until the user exits.

##  How to Run

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```
3.  Run the main program:
    ```bash
    java VendingMachine
    ```

##  Concepts Used
* Java Core (Loops, Conditionals)
* OOP (Encapsulation)
* Collections (HashMap)
* Exception Handling (try-catch, custom exceptions)
